      <description>How this began A year or so ago, whilst I was visiting England on a business trip I took the time to go down and visit my parents. During this visit my dad indulged my interest in old cameras by digging out a few of his own old cameras and a couple of his fathers. The oldest two in this group were a Kodak Number 2 Brownie, in very good order, and an extremely battered looking Ensign Greyhound folding camera.</description>

      <title>Voigtländer Vitomatic II</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased one of these on E-bay for the princely sum of 20€. This is essentially the same as the Voigtlaender Vito CL I have been using recently but with a coupled rangefinder and with the meter mirrored in the viewfinder.
Ebay listing suggests it&amp;rsquo;s fully functional, and given the classic West-German build quality of these late 1950s / early 1960s Voigtländers I have high hopes.
To date I haven&amp;rsquo;t really found the &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; 35mm camera.</description>

      <description>A new year So&amp;hellip; a new year.. the 30th new year of my life.
A new location A big year for me. Firstly I am now just two months away from moving to Munich with my girlfriend Nicole and I&amp;rsquo;m both terrified and excited at the same time. I&amp;rsquo;m not worried about moving to Germany - strangely I just &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; that this will be OK - I&amp;rsquo;m worried about the future.</description>
