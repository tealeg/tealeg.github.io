      <description>Caught on a Clojure roller-coaster I was hoping to make some decent progress this weekend with my Clojure code. The plan was to port it to the new AOT model of compilation.
However, my efforts have been frustrated by me not being able to get AOT working. I have posted my problem to the group, so hopefully there will be some solution soon.
Clojure is developing so rapidly it&amp;rsquo;s hard to keep up, I think that&amp;rsquo;s how I got into this mess with AOT.</description>
