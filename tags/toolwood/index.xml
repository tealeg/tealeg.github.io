      <description>Tech content? Hmmm I am aware that I should put more technical content here, trouble is I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to say at the moment. Work is dragging on with the same old problems with different hardware. Outside work I am actively working on something (smallish) using Erlang to get my skills in that area up to scratch before starting something else (still smallish, but bigger).
