      <description>Nic seems to specialise in taking shots of me in compromising positions. Here I am at the local Biergarten (Lochham) , drinking König Lüdwig dunkels bier (my favourite German beer) and supporting Germany in the match against Portugal.
For some reason it looks like my ear was bleeding, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t.
Role on Turkey.. probably not one to be in the center of München for given the reaction of the Turkish population here following their victory the following night.</description>

      <description>Following on from my cider related shenanigans, I&amp;rsquo;ve just found a beer I haven&amp;rsquo;t had before that&amp;rsquo;s really improved my evening.
Summer Lightning by the Hopback Brewery. You can get it in Waitrose. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice light flavour with an excellent roundness. Perfect for the glourious summer we&amp;rsquo;re not having here in the UK.
See http://www.hopback.co.uk for details.</description>
