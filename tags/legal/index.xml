      <description>Flickr stats Playing around on my flickr account today I found about flickr stats. Now these stats to turn out to be mostly quite lame and predictable, but the one that caught my eye was the referal sources. In amongst a large number of hits from flickr itself and the main search engines there was a surprising 48 hits direct from realadultsex.com (Hey this link is NSFW - stupid!)
Bad license assumptions .</description>

      <title>It makes me mad!</title>

      <description>If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing in this world that makes me mad (and there isn&amp;rsquo;t, there&amp;rsquo;s loads of things) it&amp;rsquo;s the portions of the Free/Libre/Open Source Software community who assume that anything to do with the law is inherently evil.
Every time I see this is riles me - from the anti-GFDL people in the Debian community, through the &amp;ldquo;me too&amp;rdquo; boys who decry the GPL (and especially the GPL3) as being &amp;ldquo;less free&amp;rdquo; than BSD licenses without understanding the effect of either, right down to those whom, even with the best of intentions, make statements like this.</description>
