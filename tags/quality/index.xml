      <description>DevX is not just about what we create For all the good that a Developer eXperience team can do, by creating documentation, improving APIs, building tools and libraries, and fostering community, this will only ever constitute part of the total developer experience. The foundation stones of a good developer experience are actually in the hands of the core product teams.
Delivering a quality product, which does what it should, and does it reliably, is the bedrock on which any developer&amp;#39;s eXperience is based.</description>
