      <description>The history of my blog If you look back through my historic posts (many of which I&amp;rsquo;ve recently migrated here from my historic blog spot blog), you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging, on and off, since 2007. That&amp;rsquo;s actually not true - I had done some previous blogging on another platform (all now lost), and actually I&amp;rsquo;d written occasional thoughts on various &amp;ldquo;home pages&amp;rdquo; going all the way back to 1995.</description>

      <description>A useful dialog There is an application that I have been working as an employee and a consultant for five years now. In the course of development I routinely run into a dialog in this application that handles errors at a global (or at least global to the GUI) level.
This dialog is very useful, it stops the GUI bombing out totally and presents the user with the sad news that something has gone wrong and allows them to report such an error.</description>
