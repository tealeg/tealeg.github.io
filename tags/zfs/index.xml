      <description>I continue to be totally blown away with ZFS. This post covers a lot of the reasons why. Every time I explore a feature it&amp;rsquo;s better than I was expecting. The fact that you can send incremental snapshots (essentially the binary different between two points in time) is exciting me currently. There must be the basis of so many applications there - distributed version control and package management are just two ideas that spring to mind.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with ZFS for quite a while now and I&amp;rsquo;m very impressed. Everything that&amp;rsquo;s claimed of it holds up under my limited investigation. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with both the OpenSolaris native version (thank you Nexenta!) and the ZFS-FUSE implementation for Linux.
The one thing that proved hard to do was to build a ZFS pool on my USB2 hard drive and move that pool between machines. For a couple of days I struggled in vain to see why I couldn&amp;rsquo;t ZFS export from my linux box and ZFS import on my OpenSolaris box (or visa versa).</description>
