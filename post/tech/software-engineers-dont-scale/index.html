    <div align="start" class="content"><h1 id="software-engineers-dont-scale--or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-commenting-my-code">Software Engineers don&rsquo;t scale &hellip; or how I learned to stop worrying and love commenting my code.</h1>
<p><em>NOTE: I originally published this on the <a href="https://medium.com/inside-heetch/software-engineers-dont-scale-9e374b6ee90a">Inside Heetch blog</a></em></p>
<p><a href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/forget-monoliths-vs-microservices-cognitive-load-what-matters">This
article</a>,
by Mathew Skelton and Manuel Pais, reminds me that, for everything
that’s been made simpler in this era of cloud computing and
micro-services, we’ve paid a price in terms of cognitive load. We
simply need to keep more context in mind when making or evaluating any
change to our code.</p>
<p>When we work in small teams this mass of context is quickly
internalised, but what was easy to understand initially can become a
problem as teams scale up. I’d like to explain why, and suggest some
simple steps you can take from day one to ease that pain.</p>
<h2 id="get-comfortable-its-story-time">Get comfortable, it’s story time…</h2>
<p>In the early days of a company or project, there’s very little code
maintained by very few people. This is where our story begins.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re the 2nd engineer hired into a start-up. You spend your
first days reading the few thousand lines of code that exist thus far,
and you ask your colleague “hey, in the fulfillment service I don’t
see where we charge the customer, can you help me?”. Your colleague
leans in and says, “sure, let me show you. I actually message this
other service…”, and as quick as that you’re back on track.</p>
<p>It’s easy to communicate, and to keep the context of what you’re doing
in your head, and even the context of what your colleague is doing, to
a degree.</p>
<p>You hire another engineer, let them read the code and then give them
some low-hanging fruit to work on. As they get started with one of the
tasks, they find that they are a little stuck, so they ask you “Hey,
can you show me where in the fulfillment service we initiate a charge
to the customer?” “Oh”, you say, “yes, I remember, we actually send a
message over to the charge service…”</p>
<p>After a while, you scale up and more engineers get involved. Initially
this is easy. You spend a little time explaining things and answering
questions, but eventually the new engineers get up to speed and become
productive. You’re now a senior engineer (congratulations!). One day a
new engineer asks one of the other junior engineers “Where in the
fulfillment service do we initiate the charge?”, and the junior
engineer replies “Hmm, I don’t actually remember, but I know who
will!”, and you get pulled into the conversation.</p>
<p>Now the code is growing faster and the amount of activity you have to
keep in your head is growing too. It’s no longer possible for you to
know everything that is going on.</p>
<p>Eventually, the company grows again, more engineers are hired, you’re
now a team leader (your career is stellar!). Each time an engineer
joins you and the senior engineers spend time walking them through the
projects, and then eventually they begin work. Because there is more
code now it’s harder and harder for each new engineer to understand
the full context of what is happening.</p>
<p>To be productive it’s necessary for engineers to isolate sections of
code and work on them without understanding the full context of a
program. They can confidently do this because you have good test
coverage.</p>
<p>Every day your new Slack channels are full of questions like “Hey,
Dave, where do we initiate a customer charge when fulfilling a
request?”, and answers like “I don’t know, but perhaps @Jane or
@Rakesh will?”. Your new QA Engineer is asking questions like: “I want
to make a robot test that establishes that all customers are billed
before we fulfill an order; what’s the entrance point I should use?”,
and your help-desk engineer is asking, “The customer says her browser
crashed as she was completing an order; she’s been charged, but we’ve
got no record of the order. Is that something that can happen?” The
team starts looking into these questions, but 5 minutes in comes the
question: “Hey, where do we initiate charges?”</p>
<h2 id="code-level-documentation-is-a-scaling-issue">Code level documentation is a scaling issue</h2>
<p>What is it I’m trying to show with the story above? As time
progresses, the most experienced engineers spend more and more of
their time helping the juniors in relatively trivial ways. Resolving
indirection, and providing context, not to mention all the
meta-discussion about what was or wasn’t decided, when, and by
who. Every time the senior engineering staff gets asked a question
they themselves lose track of what they were doing and have to spend
time to regain that context.</p>
<p>The cost of each change made to the code gets higher and higher, even
though we’ve been meticulous about writing good code, with good test
coverage, in a great language, backed by CI/CD and world class
tooling.</p>
<p>This might sound like a straw man argument, but it is not. It’s based
on a real-life experience of working at a start-up that lived by the
mantra “The code is the documentation”. Ultimately this policy made
scaling the engineering team hard, and wasteful.</p>
<h2 id="why-did-that-happen-and-how-can-we-avoid-it">Why did that happen, and how can we avoid it?</h2>
<p>One of the main reasons software engineers don’t always understand the
value of human language commentary mixed into their code is because
they don’t see the use case. After all, to work on source code you
must first understand it, and that means reading the code. Surely
repeating yourself in the form of in-line
comments just costs time and clutters up the source code?</p>
<p>Well, let’s take that idea a little further. Reading code implies
something more than that. Making a change to some software requires
that you read enough of the code to find the specific path through the
software that must be changed, hold a summary of that context in your
head and make a change within that context. Often you’ll cross-check
details of that context by visiting the files and functions that
comprise it.</p>
<p>This contextual summary in your mind is the very thing that is so
easily lost when someone distracts you from your code — and why we
feel frustration at those moments. This real-world context-switching
is very costly, as we have to go back, and regain the train of
thought, and frame of reference required to continue what
we were doing prior to interruption.</p>
<p>We engineers have built lots of fancy tools to help us in this quest
to navigate and understand code quickly. We have complex search tools,
automated lookup of symbol definition and consumption. Many of us
invest large amounts of time and effort into this, whilst studiously
avoiding a more direct answer.</p>
<h2 id="yes-its-just-an-engineering-problem">Yes, it’s just an engineering problem</h2>
<p>Lets think about the way we work when coding, and compare it to the
way our programs work. Here are two cases that occur commonly in
computer systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have some summary information that I have
calculated at a significant cost. I need to reference this information
a second time, how do I approach that?  Well, I store it. Perhaps in a
variable, if it’s only relevant locally, and in the short term, or in
some persistent store if it has broader or longer-term relevance. In
either case, when our process is interrupted and then later scheduled
on CPU again, we pay the cost of saving and reloading the state,
including what we calculated, but not the cost of calculating
it. Likewise, if we re-use the result, there is no additional cost.</li>
<li>I wish to access some information that I know is somewhere in a large
store of data. I have two options. I can either scan through the data
checking each item for a match, or maintain an index that can lead me
quickly to it. There is a small trade-off to be made in terms of
creating and maintaining the index, but in a great many cases this is
worthwhile because of the speed of access to the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can we translate these ideas to our own patterns of work? How do we
cache and index for an engineer? In-line comments fulfill both these
roles, they can act to cache contextual information where it is
required, and they can act as indexes to other information. Consider
the following comments from Go code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// The Service.Config struct was initialised in Service.Configure.
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This comment captures a little bit of context about where some
information being used in a function comes from. The two seconds it
took to write will save me a <code>grep</code> and trawl when I revisit this code
in 6 months time. When reading some code for the first time, I often
try and add this kind of commentary as I go.</p>
<p>Likewise, I make sure that the functions I visit are properly
documented:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// Configure initializes the Service.Config struct from the
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// configuration values stored in the file with the given path.
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">func</span> (<span style="color:#a6e22e">s</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">Service</span>) <span style="color:#a6e22e">Configure</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">configPath</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">string</span>) <span style="color:#66d9ef">error</span> {
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Why have I duplicated that information? Because referencing the member
of the structure that it initialises makes it possible to see at a
glance what it does, which again saves time.</p>
<p>Why have I deviated from the norms of Go commenting style by including
the struct name <code>Service</code>? It allows me to grep specifically for
<code>Service.Config</code> rather that <code>s.Config</code>. The code itself will refer to
<code>s.Config</code>, but in order to know that variable name used internally is s
one must already be looking at the code you want to find. Of course
convention suggest it would probably be <code>s</code>, but you cannot always be
sure.</p>
<p>As this is Go code, and <code>Service.Configure</code> is a public method of a
public structure, this comment will wind up in auto-generated
documentation as well, and such a facility exists in a great many
modern languages.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// Send an asynchronous message to the Charge
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// service. Either a ChargeInitiated message or ChargeError 
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// message will be sent back and handled by 
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// handlers.ChargeResponseHandler.
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This comment is even more of time saver — it describes the actions
with relation to another service with which this code interacts. The
message it describes might be considered a side effect of the code,
especially as we won’t block on the call, and the pointer to where the
response is handled nullifies the conceptual cost of the indirection
in the code.</p>
<p>Finally, this example points us at a non-code external
resource and answers the fundamental “why” question:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">request</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">CountryCode</span> <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;DE&#34;</span> { 
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	<span style="color:#75715e">// We&#39;re in Germany, so we cannot apply discounts to books. See 
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>	<span style="color:#75715e">//  https://github.com/MyFirm/our-project/issues/156
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="reusable-information">Reusable information</h2>
<p>Now, the great thing about comments in code is that they are
persistent and accessible by audiences other than me. Think about the
following use cases. Every one of these scenarios can be made more
efficient by spending a few seconds writing notes in your code.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-engineer-approaching-the-project">A new engineer approaching the project</h3>
<p>A decent README, detailing the intent of a program or library and its
entrance points will get a new engineer from 0-100 (or 0-60 for you
imperial types) much faster than just staring at the code. If you hand
someone a map, they&rsquo;ll get much further before they ask for
directions.</p>
<h3 id="another-software-engineer-performing-code-review-on-your-code">Another software engineer performing code review on your code</h3>
<p>I find code review is much more difficult than writing code. To do it
well requires some mental gymnastics.</p>
<p>You have to understand the flow and context of what the code was doing
before the change. You have to understand the intent of the change,
and perhaps some additional discussions and decision that led to
it. You have to understand the flow and detail of the solution, and
within that you have to see what actually changed and what effects
that will have.</p>
<p>With all of that in your head, you have to check that the right thing
has been done, and that this is in line with stylistic constraints
your team places upon code.</p>
<p>Some explanatory notes in line can work wonders with understanding the
intent of the changes whilst browsing a diff.</p>
<p>Better reviews mean  fewer bugs, and better understanding means fewer
invalid review points, which in turn makes less work for everyone
involved!</p>
<h3 id="engineers-consuming-a-library-or-package">Engineers consuming a library or package</h3>
<p>This should be obvious, but if you’re using a library to achieve
something, it is probably not your intent to invest the time to fully
understand the implementation of the library before you use it. Well
written doc-strings or documentation comments, especially where those
get automatically translated into reference documents, obviate the
need to read the code to understand the intended flow and effects of a
library.</p>
<p>This saves immeasurable time. It doesn’t matter if the engineers are
in a different company, different team, or even just dealing with a
package in a project large enough to have several of them. They could
even be QA engineers doing white box testing. The point remains: If
you make an abstraction, you should make it consumable in an abstract
way, and that means explaining what can’t be seen purely from function
signatures and variable names.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>My intent in this post has been to show that far from being a time
sink, taking the time to write down what is in your head, whilst you
work on the code can save everyone time. The time it saves only
increases as the development team grows bigger.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, there is a cost to maintaining comments and
documentation strings, but if you make this part of your work routine
you’ll find the cost is negligible when compared to the cost of
repeating the same answers over and over again in response to
inquiries. My tip is that each team member checks that comments and
documentation strings are updated when they review pull requests. If
your comments are out of sync with your code that’s an engineering
failure just as much as a poorly expressed piece of code.</p>
<p>The idea that “the code is the documentation” appeals strongly to the
engineers impulse to do what they do well, and efficiently, but it’s a
mantra that fails to recognise the difference between giving clear
instructions to a system of related computer programs, and the ability
of individual humans to deal with that complexity, or the fundamental
questions that humans always ask, and computers never do: “Why?” and
“What the ..?”</p>
